	\section*{Journey to M.Tech}
	From the reading and exploring more for new technologies I always either worked or read in detail about the new technology and always eager to interact with it. \\

	At beginning I used to work on Python because of its philosophy described in \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python}{\textbf{PEP 20 -  The Zen of Python}} and started to develop scripts for some useful. \\
	In my Bachelors study I focused more on exploring various technology and their scope and as I have explored more I came to know that I had to learn some technology or language which is near to die and replaced with various awesome technologies but more than that I learned lots of 
	When I began to explore Artificial Intelligence I came to know that the Python is best suitable language for machine learning (a Field of AI) because of it's community of packages like numpy/scipy, pandas, jupyter, sklearn etc. \\
	
	To pursue the career in research I decided to do my Masters so that I can gain more knowledge which help me build my research career. Research is not just  process which completes with just using some tools it's much more than that. I expect to gain such adequate knowledge in field of Computer Science to enhance my skills like to develop and optimize algorithm, thought spectrum.

	\section*{Life Goals}
	Inspired by various breakthrough in technology I want to pursue PhD program in \href{http://www.mit.edu/about/}{\textbf{MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology}} to research in field of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing.
	
	Artificial Intelligence is the field where large dataset is analyzed and/or real time learning and decision making processed by machine. \\

	\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing}{Quantum Computing} is the future of a new programming paradigm where quantum computer performs quantum computing is built on qubits (which can be in superposition\footnote{digital system is either on state "on" or "off" but quantum computers can be on state "on" or "off" or "on and off" at the same time}) rather than binary (0 and 1). 

%	\section*{Inspiration}
%	I believe in ideas so rather than following a single person I tend to follow ideas that drove many people to become famous in the field of research and study. I personally follow idea of "Open source" which is itself an idea followed by many communities.
%	The other quality in every successful researcher or author I have seen is patience they have great patience to get success.
